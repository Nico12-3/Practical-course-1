# Practical Course 1

This repository contains R code and data for linear regression analysis of dry weight against total cell number for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (K1) and Thalassiosira pseudonana (K9).

## Files

- `Practical course 1.R`: R script used for analysis and plotting
- `Data/Practical course 1.xlsx`: Excel file containing the experimental data
- `Plot/Practical course 1.png`: Final plot with regression lines, equations, and R² values

## Description

Linear regression was performed to model the relationship between dry weight (g) and total cell number for two algae species. The resulting plot includes:

- Regression lines for each species
- Displayed equations with R² values

## Conclusion

The analysis shows a positive linear relationship between dry weight and total cell number for both *C. reinhardtii* and *T. pseudonana*. *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* (K1) shows a stronger linear relationship with total cell number than *T. pseudonana* (K9), as reflected in the R² values.
